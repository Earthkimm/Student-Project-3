# Student-Project-3
These files of code are for me and my groups 3rd semester project.
The script 'Simulering.py' is used for plotting simulations of the inverted pendulum system, with or without data as chosen.
The primary objective for the script 'Data_plotting.py' is to be used in 'Simulering.py', but can be used to plot data alone, if so desired.
The script 'Controllability_and_Observability.py' is used for calculating and printing the controllability- and observability-matrices.
In the folder 'data' there are data files from the actual experiment.
